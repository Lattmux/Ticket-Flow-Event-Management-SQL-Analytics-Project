# Ticket-Flow-Event-Management-SQL-Analytics-Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores how SQL can be used to analyze event-management data in a realistic business scenario. I created and worked with a multi-table TicketFlow database containing information about events, attendees, bookings, tickets, venues, payments, and revenue.

The goal was to write meaningful SQL queries that answer real business questions and uncover actionable insights.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Sequel Server Management Studio (SSMS)
SQL (DDL, DML, analytical queries)
Window functions
Subqueries & CTEs
Aggregation & business metrics

### 🗂️ Database Structure
The project includes tables such as:

Events – event details, categories, dates, capacities
Attendees – customer demographics
Venues – available spaces and locations
Bookings – attendee-event transactions

Foreign keys and indexing were applied for proper relational integrity.

## 🔍 Key SQL Tasks Performed

### 1️⃣ Database Creation (DDL)

Created normalized relational tables
Set constraints and foreign keys
Established relationships across core entities

### 2️⃣ Data Insertion (DML)

Populated tables with structured synthetic data
Ensured realistic event-management scenarios

### 3️⃣ Analytical SQL Queries

I wrote queries to analyze:

✔ Event Performance
Booking volume per event
Category-based performance

✔ Customer & Booking Insights
Spending patterns across ticket types

✔ Revenue & Financial Analysis

✔ Operational Insights
No-show percentages

✔ Advanced SQL
Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)

JOINS across 2–3 related tables
Aggregations with HAVING for threshold filtering

## 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates my ability to:

✔ Build and analyze relational databases
✔ Write clean and structured SQL scripts
✔ Use SQL to solve real operational challenges
✔ Think strategically like a data analyst
